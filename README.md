# Example repo for K&R "The C Programming Language" example problems

I made this repo to keep track of problems and exercises that are found throughout the book.

A PDF format of it can be found [here](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hilder/cs833/Other%20Reference%20Materials/The%20C%20Programming%20Language.pdf)
